# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“to read two numbers and INTO complex number.

## AIM  
 to Write a python program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a complex number.
## ALGORITHM  
1.Input first number: Read an integer a from user input.

2.Input second number: Read another integer b from user input.

3.Form complex number: Create a complex number com using a as the real part and b as the imaginary part.

4.Store the result: Store the complex number in the variable com.

5.Output: Print the complex number com to the screen.  

## PROGRAM
```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
com=complex(a,b)
print(com)


```
