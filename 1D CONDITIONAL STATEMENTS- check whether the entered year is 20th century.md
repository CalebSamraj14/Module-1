## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements-  check whether the entered year is 20th century

## AIM  
TO Write a Python program to check whether the entered year is 20th century is valid or not using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. **Input year:** Read an integer value `year` from user input.
2. **Check range:** Evaluate whether `year` is between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive).
3. **Condition true:** If the condition is true, proceed to step 4.
4. **Print result (true):** Output "Year is 20th Century."
5. **Print result (false):** If the condition is false, output "Year is NOT 20th Century."

Want a flowchart or pseudocode version of this?

## PROGRAM
```python
year = int(input())

if 1900 <= year <= 2000:
    print("Year is 20th Century.")
else:
    print("Year is NOT 20th Century.")
```
