# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - python program using the assignment operator ?=,%= on the given values.

## AIM
to write  the python program using the assignment operator ?=,%= on the given values..

## ALGORITHM
1.Input values: Read three integers a, b, and c from user input.

2.Divide: Perform division b = b รท a and update b with the result (as a float).

3.Modulo: Perform modulo operation c = c % a and update c with the remainder.

4.Print b: Output the new value of b.

5.Print c: Output the new value of c.

## PROGRAM
```python

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
b/=a
c%=a
print(b)
print(c)

```
